## Check for BST :

Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.
Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.
A BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
